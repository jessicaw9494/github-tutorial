# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub
* _**Git**_ is used for version control which takes a snapshot of someones code. 
This is helpful for someone who makes mistakes in the future. 
Futhermore, Git does not require Github. 
In contrast, _**Github**_ does require Git. Github is more specific than Git because it takes 
down every change made and who contributed to that change.

## Initial Setup
_**Initial Setup**_ is used to put a title on any work changed by a person. It is a very convenient
way of saving your project without continual logging in.  

* Set up your Github account:
    1. To begin your Git&Github journey, you would need to create a Github account at [github.com](github.com). 
    This is where you can view and share your codes as a repository (folder).  
    2. Next, make an account on [c9.io](c9.io) and sign in with your Github account. This website is useful 
    for writing and saving all of your code while performing Git and Github. 
* Know your _**SSH Keys**_:
    * SSH (Secure SHell) is a URL or the location of your remote repo. Although _**HTTPS**_ is also a functional URL, HTTPS requires
     you to repeatedly log in every time. However, SSH is more convenient because it only requires 
     you to log in once.  
    * To locate your SSH URL, it can be found in your Github account. This URL is used to clone to your 
    code into c9.
* What is _**git config**_?:
    * 'git config' is a command to save your user.name and user.email. Thus, the site can remember you were the 
     one who committed the changes. 
    * The code to do so is `_$ git config --global user.name "your-name"`_ and then 
     `_$ git config --global user.email your-email@site.com"_`
